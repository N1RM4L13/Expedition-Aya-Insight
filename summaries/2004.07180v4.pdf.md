## Abstract Summary

- **Background:** Representation learning is critical for natural language processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are limited to token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power.
- **Problem:** Existing pretrained language models like BERT cannot learn optimal document representations because they only consider intra-document context and do not use any inter-document information.
- **Methodology:** The authors propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph.
- **Key Findings:**
  - SPECTER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a variety of document-level tasks, including topic classification, citation prediction, and recommendation.
  - SPECTER achieves an average performance of 80.0 across all metrics on all tasks, which is a 3.1 point absolute improvement over the next-best baseline.
  - SPECTER embeddings are better at encoding topical information compared to SciBERT, as the clusters seem to be more compact.
  - SPECTER does not require task-specific fine-tuning, making it applicable in situations where metadata is not available.
- **Conclusion:** SPECTER is an effective and versatile model for learning representations of scientific papers, outperforming various baselines and demonstrating the importance of citation-based pretraining.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | SPECTER outperforms baselines | SPECTER's representations substantially outperform state-of-the-art baselines on various tasks, including document classification, citation prediction, and recommendation. |
| 2 | SPECTER does not require fine-tuning | SPECTER can be applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning, making it versatile and cost-effective. |
| 3 | Introduction of SCIDOCS | SCIDOCS is a novel collection of datasets and an evaluation suite for document-level embeddings in the scientific domain, covering seven tasks and including anonymized user signals of document relatedness. |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
* SPECTER improves upon prior work by incorporating citation information as an inter-document relatedness signal, which is critical for its performance.
* Unlike Citeomatic (Bhagavatula et al., 2018), SPECTER does not require citation information at inference time, making it applicable to new, uncited papers.
* SPECTER outperforms graph-based methods like SGC (Wu et al., 2019a) on co-citation tasks while being usable in real-world settings for embedding new papers.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$v = \text{Transformer(input)}[\text{CLS}]$$ | Represents a paper as a dense vector (embedding) | Enables the model to process and compare papers in a vector space, facilitating tasks like classification and recommendation. |
| $$L = \max\left\{\left(d(PQ, P^+) - d(PQ, P^-) + m\right), 0\right\}$$ | Triplet margin loss function for training the model | Encourages the model to learn representations where related papers are closer together and unrelated papers are farther apart, improving document relatedness modeling. |

## Related Work

| Topic/Area | Previous Approaches | This Paper's Innovation / Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **Document Representation** | Extensions of word vectors to documents, convolution-based methods, and variational autoencoders. | SPECTER builds embeddings from the title and abstract of a paper using a Transformer LM (e.g., SciBERT) and takes the final representation of the [CLS] token as the output representation of the paper. |
| **Citation-Based Learning** | Context-based citation recommendation models rely on citation contexts to make predictions. | SPECTER uses citations as an inter-document relatedness signal and formulates it as a triplet loss learning objective. |
| **Evaluation and Benchmarking** | Previous evaluations of scientific document representations tend to focus on small datasets over a limited set of tasks. | Introduces SCIDOCS, a new evaluation suite consisting of seven document-level tasks and releases the corresponding datasets to foster further research in this area. |

**Gap Addressed:**
* **Lack of Document-Level Representation Focus:** Prior work in NLP has primarily focused on sentence- and token-level tasks, with document-level representation learning remaining relatively under-explored. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on document-level representation learning for scientific papers.
* **Incorporation of Inter-Document Relatedness:** Many existing approaches, including pretrained language models like BERT, do not effectively leverage inter-document relatedness, which is crucial for tasks like citation prediction and recommendation. SPECTER incorporates this by using citations as a signal of inter-document relatedness.
* **Need for Larger and More Diverse Benchmarks:** The paper highlights the need for new, larger, and more diverse benchmark datasets to evaluate scientific document representations effectively. It addresses this by introducing the SCIDOCS evaluation framework.
